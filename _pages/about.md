<p>Welcome to my website! My <strong> <a class="news-title" href="https://restuccialab.github.io/publications/"> research interests </a> </strong> are the design and experimental evaluation of next-generation wireless systems, with application spanning from the Internet of Things to NextG cellular communications. My technical expertise includes (i) embedded system design and development; (ii) machine learning algorithms and frameworks; (iii) wireless communication standards and architectures; (iv) software-defined radio design and development. Over the years, I invented or co-invented <strong> <a class="news-title" href="https://patents.google.com/?inventor=Francesco+Restuccia&oq=inventor:(Francesco+Restuccia)"> a number of patents </a> </strong> in these areas.</p>

<p> My <strong> <a class="news-title" href="https://restuccialab.github.io/Laboratory/"> research group </a> </strong> is generously supported by <strong> <a class="news-title" href="https://restuccialab.github.io/projects/"> a number of projects </a> </strong> funded by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Defense. I am a member of the  <strong> <a class="news-title" href="https://roux.northeastern.edu/"> Roux Institute </a> </strong>  and the <strong> <a class="news-title" href="https://www.northeastern.edu/wiot/">  Institute for the Wireless Internet of Things  </a> </strong>  at Northeastern University.
