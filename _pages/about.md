<p>Welcome to my website! My <strong> <a class="news-title" href="https://restuccialab.github.io/publications/"> research interests </a> </strong> are the design and experimental evaluation of next-generation edge-assisted wireless systems, with applications spanning from the Internet of Things to NextG cellular communications. My technical expertise includes (i) embedded system design and development; (ii) machine learning algorithms and frameworks; (iii) edge computing algorithms and paradigms; (iv) wireless communication standards and architectures; (v) software-defined radio design and development. Over the years, I invented or co-invented <strong> <a class="news-title" href="https://patents.google.com/?inventor=Francesco+Restuccia&oq=inventor:(Francesco+Restuccia)"> a number of patents </a> </strong> in these areas.</p>
