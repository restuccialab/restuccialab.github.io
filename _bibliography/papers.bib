@article{baldesi2022charm,
  abbr={Preprint},
  abstract={oday’s radio access networks (RANs) are monolithic
  entities which often operate statically on a given set of parameters
  for the entirety of their operations. To implement realistic and
  effective spectrum sharing policies, RANs will need to seamlessly
  and intelligently change their operational parameters. In stark
  contrast with existing paradigms, the new O-RAN architectures
  for 5G-and-beyond networks (NextG) separate the logic that con-
  trols the RAN from its hardware substrate, allowing unprece-
  dented real-time fine-grained control of RAN components. In
  this context, we propose the Channel-Aware Reactive Mechanism
  (ChARM), a data-driven O-RAN-compliant framework that allows
  (i) sensing the spectrum to infer the presence of interference
  and (ii) reacting in real time by switching the distributed unit
  (DU) and radio unit (RU) operational parameters according to
  a specified spectrum access policy. ChARM is based on neural
  networks operating directly on unprocessed I/Q waveforms to
  determine the current spectrum context. ChARM does not require
  any modification to the existing 3GPP standards. It is designed
  to operate within the O-RAN specifications, and can be used in
  conjunction with other spectrum sharing mechanisms (e.g., LTE-
  U, LTE-LAA or MulteFire). We demonstrate the performance of
  ChARM in the context of spectrum sharing among LTE and Wi-
  Fi in unlicensed bands, where a controller operating over a RAN
  Intelligent Controller (RIC) senses the spectrum and switches
  cell frequency to avoid Wi-Fi. We develop a prototype of ChARM
  using srsRAN, and leverage the Colosseum channel emulator to
  collect a large-scale waveform dataset to train our neural networks
  with. To collect standard-compliant Wi-Fi data, we extended the
  Colosseum testbed using system-on-chip (SoC) boards running
  a modified version of the OpenWiFi architecture. Experimental
  results show that ChARM achieves accuracy of up to 96% on
  Colosseum and 85% on an over-the-air testbed, demonstrating the
  capacity of ChARM to exploit the considered spectrum channels},

@article{callegaro2022smartdet,
  abbr={Preprint},
  abstract={Mobile devices increasingly rely on object detec-
  tion (OD) through deep neural networks (DNNs) to perform
  critical tasks. Due to their high complexity, the execution of
  these DNNs requires excessive time and energy. Low-complexity
  object tracking (OT) can be used with OD, where the latter is
  periodically applied to generate “fresh” references for tracking.
  However, the frames processed with OD incur large delays,
  which may make the reference outdated and degrade tracking
  quality. Herein, we propose to use edge computing in this
  context, and establish parallel OT (at the mobile device) and
  OD (at the edge server) processes that are resilient to large OD
  latency. We propose Katch-Up, a novel tracking mechanism that
  improves the system resilience to excessive OD delay. However,
  while Katch-Up significantly improves performance, it also
  increases the computing load of the mobile device. Hence, we
  design SmartDet, a low-complexity controller based on deep
  reinforcement learning (DRL) that learns controlling the trade-
  off between resource utilization and OD performance. SmartDet
  takes as input context-related information related to the current
  video content and the current network conditions to optimize
  frequency and type of OD offloading, as well as Katch-Up
  utilization. We extensively evaluate SmartDet on a real-world
  testbed composed of a JetSon Nano as mobile device and a
  GTX 980 Ti as edge server, connected through a Wi-Fi link.
  Experimental results show that SmartDet achieves an optimal
  balance between tracking performance – mean Average Recall
  (mAR) and resource usage. With respect to a baseline with full
  Katch-Up usage and maximum channel usage, we still increase
  mAR by 4% while using 50% less of the channel and 30% power
  resources associated with Katch-Up. With respect to a fixed
  strategy using minimal resources, we increase mAR by 20% while
  using Katch-Up on 1/3 of the frames.},

  abstract={Wireless systems such as the Internet of Things (IoT) are changing the way we interact with the cyber and the physical world. As IoT systems become more and more pervasive, it is imperative to design wireless protocols that can effectively and efficiently support IoT devices and operations. On the other hand, today's IoT wireless systems are based on inflexible designs, which makes them inefficient and prone to a variety of wireless attacks. In this paper, we introduce the new notion of a deep learning-based polymorphic IoT receiver, able to reconfigure its waveform demodulation strategy itself in real time, based on the inferred waveform parameters. Our key innovation is the introduction of a novel embedded deep learning architecture that enables the solution of waveform inference problems, which is then integrated into a generalized hardware/software architecture with radio components and signal processing. Our polymorphic wireless receiver is prototyped on a custom-made software-defined radio platform. We show through extensive over-the-air experiments that the system achieves throughput within 87% of a perfect-knowledge Oracle system, thus demonstrating for the first time that polymorphic receivers are feasible.},

@article{matsubara2022bottlefit,
  abbr={Preprint},

  abstract={Although mission-critical applications require the
  use of deep neural networks (DNNs), their continuous execution
  at mobile devices results in a significant increase in energy con-
  sumption. While edge offloading can decrease energy consump-
  tion, erratic patterns in channel quality, network and edge server
  load can lead to severe disruption of the system’s key operations.
  An alternative approach, called split computing, generates com-
  pressed representations within the model (called “bottlenecks”),
  to reduce bandwidth usage and energy consumption. Prior work
  has proposed approaches that introduce additional layers, to the
  detriment of energy consumption and latency. For this reason,
  we propose a new framework called BottleFit, which, in
  addition to targeted DNN architecture modifications, includes
  a novel training strategy to achieve high accuracy even with
  strong compression rates. We apply BottleFit on cutting-edge
  DNN models in image classification, and show that BottleFit
  achieves 77.1% data compression with up to 0.6% accuracy loss
  on ImageNet dataset, while state of the art such as SPINN loses
  up to 6% in accuracy. We experimentally measure the power
  consumption and latency of an image classification application
  running on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano board (GPU-based) and
  a Raspberry PI board (GPU-less). We show that BottleFit
  decreases power consumption and latency respectively by up to
  49% and 89% with respect to (w.r.t.) local computing and by 37%
  and 55% w.r.t. edge offloading. We also compare BottleFit
  with state-of-the-art autoencoders-based approaches, and show
  that (i) BottleFit reduces power consumption and execution
  time respectively by up to 54% and 44% on the Jetson and 40%
  and 62% on Raspberry PI; (ii) the size of the head model executed
  on the mobile device is 83 times smaller. The code repository will
  be published for full reproducibility of the results.},

@inproceedings{tehrani2021federated,
  abbr={Conference},
  abstract={Next Generation (NextG) networks are expected to
  support demanding tactile internet applications such as aug-
  mented reality and connected autonomous vehicles. Whereas
  recent innovations bring the promise of larger link capacity,
  their sensitivity to the environment and erratic performance
  defy traditional model-based control rationales. Zero-touch data-
  driven approaches can improve the ability of the network
  to adapt to the current operating conditions. Tools such as
  reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can build optimal control
  policy solely based on a history of observations. Specifically,
  deep RL (DRL), which uses a deep neural network (DNN)
  as a predictor, has been shown to achieve good performance
  even in complex environments and with high dimensional inputs.
  However, the training of DRL models require a large amount of
  data, which may limit its adaptability to ever-evolving statistics
  of the underlying environment. Moreover, wireless networks
  are inherently distributed systems, where centralized DRL ap-
  proaches would require excessive data exchange, while fully
  distributed approaches may result in slower convergence rates
  and performance degradation. In this paper, to address these
  challenges, we propose a federated learning (FL) approach to
  DRL, which we refer to federated DRL (F-DRL), where base
  stations (BS) collaboratively train the embedded DNN by only
  sharing models’ weights rather than training data. We evaluate
  two distinct versions of F-DRL, value and policy based, and show
  the superior performance they achieve compared to distributed
  and centralized DRL},

  abstract={Colosseum is an open-access and publicly-available large-scale wireless testbed for experimental research via virtualized and softwarized waveforms and protocol stacks on a fully programmable, “white-box” platform. Through 256 state-of-the-art software-defined radios and a massive channel emulator core, Colosseum can model virtually any scenario, enabling the design, development and testing of solutions at scale in a variety of deployments and channel conditions. These Colosseum radio-frequency scenarios are reproduced through high-fidelity FPGAbased emulation with finite-impulse response filters. Filters model the taps of desired wireless channels and apply them to the signals generated by the radio nodes, faithfully mimicking the conditions of real-world wireless environments. In this paper, we introduce Colosseum as a testbed that is for the first time open to the research community. We describe the architecture of Colosseum and its experimentation and emulation capabilities. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of Colosseum for experimental research at scale through exemplary use cases including prevailing wireless technologies (e.g., cellular and Wi-Fi) in spectrum sharing and unmanned aerial vehicle scenarios. A roadmap for Colosseum future updates concludes the paper.},

  title={Practical location validation in participatory sensing through mobile wifi hotspots},

  abstract={The reliability of information in participatory sensing (PS) systems largely depends on the accuracy of the location of the participating users. However, existing PS applications are not able to efficiently validate the position of users in large-scale outdoor environments. In this paper, we present an efficient and scalable Location Validation System (LVS) to secure PS systems from location-spoofing attacks. In particular, the user location is verified with the help of mobile WiFi hot spots (MHSs), which are users activating the WiFi hotspot capability of their smartphones and accept connections from nearby users, thereby validating their position inside the sensing area. The system also comprises a novel verification technique called Chains of Sight, which tackles collusion-based attacks effectively. LVS also includes a reputation-based algorithm that rules out sensing reports of location-spoofing users. The feasibility and efficiency of the WiFi-based approach of LVS is demonstrated by a set of indoor and outdoor experiments conducted using off-the-shelf smartphones in Pisa, Italy, while the energy-efficiency of LVS is demonstrated by experiments using the Power Monitor energy tool. Finally, the security properties of LVS are analyzed by simulation experiments. Results indicate that the proposed LVS system is energy-efficient, applicable to most of the practical PS scenarios, and efficiently secures existing PS systems from location-spoofing attacks.},

  abbr={Journal},

  abstract={Mobile crowdsensing harnesses the sensing power of modern smartphones to collect and analyze data beyond the scale of what was previously possible with traditional sensor networks. Given the participatory nature of mobile crowdsensing, it is imperative to incentivize mobile users to provide sensing services in a timely and reliable manner. Most importantly, given sensed information is often valid for a limited period of time, the capability of smartphone users to execute sensing tasks largely depends on their mobility pattern, which is often uncertain. For this reason, in this paper, we propose IncentMe, a framework that solves this core issue by leveraging game-theoretical reverse auction mechanism design. After demonstrating that the proposed problem is NP-hard, we derive two mechanisms that are parallelizable and achieve higher approximation ratio than existing work. IncentMe has been extensively evaluated on a road traffic monitoring application implemented using mobility traces of taxi cabs in San Francisco, Rome, and Beijing. Results demonstrate that the mechanisms in IncentMe outperform the state of the art work by improving the efficiency in recruiting participants by 30 percent.},

  abstract= { Recent technological advances have brought to the end-user market smartphones that are able to remain fully-functional even when submerged under water. This capability will soon enable the commercialization of a plethora of exciting smartphone apps, including life-saving systems such as real-time monitoring of scuba divers breathing. On the other hand, it becomes paramount to empower smartphones with end-to-end underwater communication capabilities. In this paper, we propose iSonar, the first system implementing reliable software-defined acoustic networking between water-proof smartphones. Specifically, iSonar transforms off-the-shelf smartphones into ultrasonic software "radios" that implement an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-based communication system to exchange data under water. To this end, iSonar sends and receives information through the AUX interface and by implementing a lightweight network stack entirely in software. We have implemented a fully-functional hardware/software prototype of iSonar on Android smartphones and off-the-shelf electronic equipment, and extensively evaluated its performance through several experiments in a tank testbed. Results show that iSonar is able to achieve packet error rate (PER) of 10-3, which is significant considering the low audio sampling rate and the strong multipath effect induced by the water tank environment.},
