As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to grow at a fast pace, the increasing number of wireless devices in the frequency spectrum up to 6 GHz creates a compelling need to securely adapt IoT communications based on availability in the wireless spectrum environment. Autonomous coordination of wireless transmissions to avoid congestions becomes particularly important when numerous IoT devices with stringent power consumption restrictions communicate with an edge device connected to the cloud; collecting information with relatively low data rates such as biomedical signals, detected gases/chemicals levels, temperature, humidity, or vibration data. Such low-power IoT device applications include medical and health care, smart homes, transportation, manufacturing, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. It is imperative to design IoT networks with resilience features deeply embedded across layers from the integrated circuit level to the wireless system level. When IoT devices are employed with sensors in increasingly crowded environments to transmit sensed information, it is essential to increase their awareness of incumbent spectrum users and avoid interference. An overarching goal of this project is to create spectrum-agile IoT networks with low-power adaptive radio frequency (RF) circuits at the sensor nodes, and with coordinated optimization and enhanced security at the edge device. The synergies between the circuits, computing, and wireless networking components of this research are anticipated to create a paradigm for resilient next-generation IoT networks with energy-efficient secure communication between sensor nodes and edge devices. Research and education will be integrated by incorporating the obtained knowledge into graduate and undergraduate education. In addition, high school interns will be engaged through the Center for STEM Education at Northeastern University.
