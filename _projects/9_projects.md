In this project, we will research the underlying algorithmic foundations and theoretical performance bounds of future dynamic data-driven wireless systems. The key target of this project is to achieve strategic mission-critical application-level objectives by guaranteeing assured wireless communications in congested, contested, concealed, and contaminated environments. First, we mathematically optimize network operations through dynamic allocation of network, computation, and memory resources, taking into account the semantics of the sensed data and the current spectrum conditions into the problem formulation. Importantly, our optimization dynamically compresses sensed data according to application-level semantics, so that network load can be minimized while still guaranteeing key application performance indicators.  Next, we investigate novel techniques to guarantee the performance of the proposed data-driven optimization and classification techniques in terms of latency, accuracy, and resource occupation in challenged and constrained scenarios. Our key theoretical findings will be extensively validated through extensive data collection campaigns leveraging several wireless testbeds available at the Institute for the Wireless Internet of Things.

The Air Force Office of Scientific Research, or AFOSR, expands the horizon of scientific knowledge through its leadership and management of the Department of the Air Force's basic research program. As a vital component of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), AFOSR's mission is to discover, shape, champion and transitions high- risk basic research that profoundly impacts the future Air and Space Forces. AFOSR accomplishes its mission through global investment in advanced discovery research efforts in relevant scientific areas. Central to AFOSR's strategy is the transfer of the fruits of basic research to industry, the supplier of Department of the Air Force acquisitions; to the academic community, which can lead the way to still more accomplishment; and to the other directorates of AFRL that carry the responsibility for applied research leading to acquisition.
